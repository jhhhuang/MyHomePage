abstract: Optical solitons in multimode nonlinear optical systems offer a unique
  platform for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity, dispersion, and spatial
  mode coupling, offering insights into complex nonlinear wave phenomena.
  Multi-pass cavities (MPCs) incorporating nonlinear Kerr media serve as
  prototypical systems, enabling high-efficiency supercontinuum generation and
  pulse compression. However, stabilizing femtosecond laser pulses in
  solid-medium-based MPCs (solid MPCs) under high Kerr nonlinearity remains a
  significant challenge due to multimode coupling, which disrupts beam
  stability. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the
  stability of laser pulses in MPCs using Floquet analysis and first-order
  perturbation theory. We identify novel mode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium
  lengths, where destructive interference among multimode wave components
  suppresses coupling and facilitates soliton stabilization. Under MCS
  conditions, we demonstrate stable beam propagation in solid MPCs with
  nonlinear phases up to 1.85{\pi} per pass, achieving 10-fold pulse compression
  with exceptional spatio-spectral homogeneity. Our findings offer valuable
  guidance for designing advanced MPCs with tailored Kerr media.
