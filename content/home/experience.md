  - title: Femtosecond laser pulse compression using solitary modes in nonlinear multi-pass cell
    company: Supervised by Prof. [Zhensheng Tao](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/16/4b/c7605a136779/page.htm)
    company_url: ''
    location: Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-08-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
       * Used the moified Fox-Li iteration algorithm to find the eigenmodes of nonliear multi-pass cell with Kerr media.
       * Performed the NLSE simulation to verify the stability of the eigenmodes, i.e., the formation of solitons and its stability.
       * Currently building the experimental setup.

  - title: Blind FROG (Frequency Resolved Optical Gating) Algorithm
    company: Supervised by Prof. [Zhensheng Tao](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/16/4b/c7605a136779/page.htm)
    company_url: ''
    location: Fudan University
    date_start: '2021-05-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-01'
    description: |2-
       * Implemented the Principle Component Generalized Prijection Algorithm (PCGPA) and Ptychographic algorithm for Blind FROG.
       * Introduced ramdom numbers to optimize the PCGPA Algotithm so that it's suitable for Blind FROG problems.
